# Kmeans_Python_Image

K-means is a centroid-based algorithm i.e. distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. 
In this algorithm, elements are grouped into k clusters such that all elements in the same cluster are as similar to each other as possible. And elements not in the same cluster are as different as possible. 

This repository contains python implementation of the K-means algorithm on two images.

# How to use?

I have provided the code for k-means = 2 for human profile and k=3 for waterfall image. <br>
One can play around with the k-value to obtain different k-means images.
